# 18.1 Bug Fixes in all update user details controllers & endpoints

## 1. “form-data” option error in postman for changeFullName controller

**Explanation:**

So, while i was using postman to test the api response, i was sending text-only data in `form-data` option, which gave this error.
So to fix it i changed the option to `x-www—form-urlencoded` option, this option sends the data in JSON format and the bug was fixed.

```json
{
    "statusCode": 400,
    "userMessage": "Validation errors",
    "errors": [
        {
            "type": "field",
            "msg": "Full name is required",
            "path": "fullName",
            "location": "body"
        }
    ],
    "success": false,
    "data": null
} // response in postman
```

## 2. Fixing getCurrentUser Controller

**File:** `user.controller.js`

**controller name:** `getCurrentUser`

### Bug 1: ! & isEmpty() was not used

Before:

```
if (errors) {
    const validationErrors = new ApiError(
      400,
      "Validation errors",
```

After:

```
if (!errors.isEmpty()) {
    const validationErrors = new ApiError(
      400,
      "Validation errors",
      errors.array()
    );
    return res.status(validationErrors.statusCode).json(validationErrors);
  }
```

Explanation:

- `const errors = validationResult(req);`
    
    The **`validationResult`** function returns an object with the following properties:
    
    - **`isEmpty()`**: A method that returns **`true`** if there are no validation errors, and **`false`** otherwise.
    - **`array()`**: A method that returns an array of validation errors. Each error object in the array typically has properties like **`param`** (the parameter name), **`msg`** (the error message), and **`value`** (the value that failed validation).
    - So, the mistake was that in if statement  i should have checked for this: `(!errors.isEmpty())`  that tells about the if errors are found or not.

## 3. Fixing changeCurrentPassword Controller

**File:** `user.controller.js`

**controller name:** `changeCurrentPassword`

### Bug 1: Status code error

Before:

```
RangeError [ERR_HTTP_INVALID_STATUS_CODE]: Invalid status code: ApiError: Wrong old password
at file:///C:/Users/amol/Documents/GitHub/mega-project-javascript-backend/src/controllers/user.controller.js:367:34 {
statusCode: 400,
userMessage: 'Wrong old password',
errors: [],
success: false,
data: null
}
at new NodeError (node:internal/errors:405:5)
at ServerResponse.writeHead (node:_http_server:347:11)
at ServerResponse._implicitHeader (node:*http_server:338:8)
at write* (node:_http_outgoing:915:9)
at ServerResponse.end (node:_http_outgoing:1026:5)
at ServerResponse.send (C:\Users\amol\Documents\GitHub\mega-project-javascript-backend\node_modules\express\lib\response.js:232:10)    at ServerResponse.json (C:\Users\amol\Documents\GitHub\mega-project-javascript-backend\node_modules\express\lib\response.js:278:15)    at file:///C:/Users/amol/Documents/GitHub/mega-project-javascript-backend/src/controllers/user.controller.js:368:45 {
code: 'ERR_HTTP_INVALID_STATUS_CODE'
```

explanation for error:

- well, here `res.status()` was not getting a status code to show, as i didn’t provided one accidently, so this error came.

```
if (!isPasswordCorrect) {
      const wrongPasswordError = new ApiError(400, "Wrong old password");
      return res.status(wrongPasswordError).json(wrongPasswordError);
    }
```

After:

```
if (!isPasswordCorrect) {
      const wrongPasswordError = new ApiError(400, "Wrong old password");
      return res.status(wrongPasswordError.statusCode).json(wrongPasswordError);
```

explanation for fix:

- well, after adding .statusCode, which is coming from wrongPasswordError object, error went away.

### Bug2: Same Bug From Point 2 of this documentation the “! & isEmpty() was not used”

Fixed the same way as point 2.

## 4. Fixing changeAvatar Controller

**File:** `user.controller.js`

**controller name:** `changeAvatar`

### Bug 1: Given avatar(profile pic) by front-end(postman) was not being uploaded to server & cloudinary.com(popular file handling server)

Before:

```
if (req.file) {
    avatarLocalPath = req.file.avatar?.path; // here is the error
  }
```

After:

```
if (req.file) {
    avatarLocalPath = req.file.path; // proper handling of it
  }
```

Explanation for fix:

- Here `file` is a object that is added to `req` by the `multer` middleware. So i was accidently handling the `file` object wrong and incorrectly.
- So, i console.log the `req.file` and see the structure of it, then i handled it properly and the error was fixed.
- See the code to know how i handled it.

### Bug 2: Again incorrect handling of “req.file”

 Before:

```
if (!req.file || !req.file.avatar) {
    const fileError = new ApiError(400, "Avatar is Required", [
      { msg: "avatar image is not provided" },
    ]);
```

After:

```
if (!req.file || !req.file.fieldname) {
    const fileError = new ApiError(400, "Avatar is Required", [
      { msg: "avatar image is not provided" },
    ]);
```

Code is self explanatory.

### Bug 3: Could not upload the static files to cloudinary platform

Before:

```
if (!avatarLocalPath) {
      avatarResponse = await uploadOnCloudinary(avatarLocalPath);
```

Explanation:

- The issue is in if-block’s condition logic, see i was using “!”, i should not use it.
So the logic here is saying if the variable (avatarLocalPath) has the path of the avatar image, then do not upload it. hahahaha.

After:

```
if (avatarLocalPath) {
      avatarResponse = await uploadOnCloudinary(avatarLocalPath);
```

Explanation:

- Yeah so i removed the “!” sign and now avatar images are successfully being uploaded to cloudinary.com

### Bug 4: Accidently sending sensitive user info in response

Before:

```
const successResponse = new ApiResponse(
      200,
      "Avatar updated successfully",
      updatedUser._doc
    );
```

Explanation:

- So in the successful response i was sending the complete database document of user,
which included “hashed-password” and “refreshToken” of user too.

After:

```
const successResponse = new ApiResponse(
      200,
      "Avatar updated successfully",
      { ...updatedUser._doc, password: undefined, refreshToken: undefined }
    );
```

Explanation:

- So i fixed it using spread operator and simple JavaScript logic.

## 5. Fixing changeCoverImage Controller

**File:** `user.controller.js`

**controller name:** `changeCoverImage`

**Note:** In this controller the same to same bugs that were encountered in `changeAvatar` controller were occurred and these bugs are fixed the same way, so need for explanation.

---

## 6. Fixed Update Cover Image Endpoint.

**Explanation for fix:**

So, i was accidently using same controller and same fieldname for multer middleware so i changed it.

Before:

```jsx
router // avatar update endpoint
  .route("/update-user-avatar")
  .post([verifyJWT, upload.single("avatar")], changeAvatar); 

router // cover image update endpoint
  .route("/update-user-coverImage")
  .post([verifyJWT, upload.single("avatar")], changeAvatar); // same controller and argument name as above endpoint
```

After:

```jsx
router
  .route("/update-user-coverImage")
  .post([verifyJWT, upload.single("coverImage")], changeCoverImage); // fixed it by updating controller name and accurate argument name
```
