# 14.1 Improvement/ Bug fixes/ New Features: Register Controller

Created: January 26, 2024 6:02 PM

## All The Changes In Code:

To see previous code, please visit relevant commits on this GitHub repository.

Current Latest In-Use, Register Controller Code:

- [x]  tested
- [x]  debugged
- [x]  bug fixes
- [x]  improvements in speed and performance

> Postman testing results:
Earlier, Api was taking around 8-13 seconds to register a user in optimal conditions.
Now, after all the improvements, Api is taking only 3-4 seconds to register a user in optimal conditions.

## Bug 1: forgot to put “()”

- In **user.controller.js:**
    
    `username: username.toLowerCase`
    
    to
    `username: username.toLowerCase()`
    
- .toLowerCase without “()” was not working, & due to this username field was not getting properly added in database, as i forgot to add parenthesis.
- Now, its working as expected.

## Bug 2: Multer middleware was not adding file extension

- Multer middleware (multer.middlware.js) is used to add files to server temporarily in ./public/temp folder, after user uploads them thorough frontend in a html form or some other way.
- But when multer middleware gets the images or files, it correctly saves the files in the ./public/temp. But file extension (.pdf, .png, .jpg, .jpeg etc.) is not added after the filenames.
- So this issue is fixed by using this logic:
    - **earlier:**
        
        ```jsx
        cb(null, file.fieldname + "-" + uniqueSuffix);
        // this, earlier code is not capable to put file extension after generating name of file.
        ```
        
    - **now:**
        
        ```jsx
        cb(null, file.fieldname + "-" + uniqueSuffix + "." + file.originalname.split(".").pop() );
        ```
        
        **Working:**
        
        - First it generates a file name as usual,
        - Then adds a “.” after generated filename,
        - Then it takes the original file name from the file and split it into a array using split(”.”),
        - Then here is the logic, as we know file’s extension is always at the last of filename (hi_i_am_a_photo.jpg, here .jpg is at last) & we used `split(”.”)` method to add make a array out of this filename `([ hi_i_am_a_photo, jpg ])`.
        - Now `pop()` will pop the last item of array, which will always be the file extension.
        - Example: some_random_string_generated_as_file_name → face.of.alexander.jpg ( original_name_of_uploaded_file ) → [ face, of, alexander, jpg ] ( using split(”.”) ) → jpg ( popped from array using pop() )→ some_random_string_generated_as_file_name.jpg ( last generated file name ).
        
        So using this logic i was able to add file extension… to any file that the multer middleware uploaded to the server.
        

## Bug 3: Unlink files after they are uploaded to cloudinary

- If files that were uploaded temporarily to server by multer are successfully uploaded to cloudinary using `cloudinary.js` utility then these files must be unlinked from our server too.
- Adding this line of code in cloudinary.js utility does that:
    
    ```jsx
    fs.unlinkSync(localFilePath);
    ```
    
    Done.
    

## Bug 4: Undefined Error when coverImage is not sent through postman during api testing of register controller

- Actually, in mongoose data model coverImage is not required and it can be skipped by user if they want it during registration, but during api testing using postman, when coverImage is not sent it return a error.
- `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '0')`
- This error was coming on this line of code in file `user.controller.js`.
    
    ```jsx
    const coverImageLocalPath = req.files?.coverImage[0]?.path;
    // this error is generated during reading [0]th index of array named coverImage
    ```
    
- Optional chaining is applied, but error is not linked to optional chaining.
    
    It is related to arrays. When in coverImage[0]… [0]th index is being read but it do not exist, then this error of undefined occurs.
    
    ### Solution:
    
    - A if/else block of code can be used to check some conditions & only if those conditions are met only then run this line of code to prevent undefined error.
    
    ```jsx
    let coverImageLocalPath;
      if (
        req.files &&
        Array.isArray(req.files.coverImage) &&
        req.files.coverImage.length > 0
      ) {
        coverImageLocalPath = req.files?.coverImage[0]?.path;
      }
    ```
    
    - **Conditions are:**
        - There must be req.files object in req object. This object is automatically added by multer middleware.
        - The req.files.coverImage must be a array.
        - Then the length of this array must be > 0, indicating that array contains at least one element in it. Safely allowing us to use coverImage[0] without any error.
        - Done, we are set.
- **Note: This s**ame if/else block and logic is used for `avatarLocalPath`, because same error was being returned during api testing using postman.
    
    ```jsx
    let avatarLocalPath;
      if (
        req.files &&
        Array.isArray(req.files.avatar) &&
        req.files.avatar.length > 0
      ) {
        coverImageLocalPath = req.files?.avatar[0]?.path;
      }
    ```
    

## Bug 4: “Message” field conflict with NodeJS “Error class” and postman not showing message field when ApiError response is given by register controller (apiError.js file)

**Error Code:**

```jsx
class ApiError extends Error {
  constructor(
    statusCode,
    message = "An error occured",
    errors = [],
    stack = ""
  ) {
    super(message || "An error occured"); // calls the constructor function of NodeJS Error class.
    this.statusCode = statusCode;
    this.message = message;
    this.errors = errors;
    this.success = false;
    this.data = null;

    if (stack) {
      this.stack = stack;
    } else {
      Error.captureStackTrace(this, this.constructor);
    }
  }
}

export { ApiError };
```

**Fixed Code:**

```jsx
class ApiError extends Error {
  constructor(
    statusCode,
    userMessage = "An error occurred",
    errors = [],
    stack = ""
  ) {
    super(userMessage || "An error occurred"); // calls the constructor function of NodeJS Error class.
    this.statusCode = statusCode;
    this.userMessage = userMessage; // Use a different name here
    this.errors = errors;
    this.success = false;
    this.data = null;

    if (stack) {
      this.stack = stack;
    } else {
      Error.captureStackTrace(this, this.constructor);
    }
  }
}

export { ApiError };
```

**Reason:**

The reason not seeing the "message" field in Postman is because the **`message`** property of the **`Error`** class conflicts with custom property also named **`message`**. When **`this.message = message;`** in **`ApiError`** constructor, it override the inherited **`message`** property from the **`Error`** class.

To avoid this conflict and ensure that the custom **`message`** property i want is included in the response, change the name of the custom property. For example, rename it to **`userMessage`**

## Bug 5: Personal mistake, always getting “user already exist” error response from api, Even after sending request with completely different details in postman

I mistakenly used “fullName” field instead of “email” field.

**Error Code (fullName is given):**

```jsx
const existingUser = await User.findOne({
        $or: [{ username }, { fullName}], // see here
      });
      console.log(existingUser);
      if (existingUser) {
        const userExistsError = new ApiError(400, "User Already Exists", [
          { msg: "username or email already exist." },
        ]);
        return res.status(userExistsError.statusCode).json(userExistsError);
      }
```

**Fixed Code (now email is given):**

```jsx
const existingUser = await User.findOne({
        $or: [{ username }, { email }], // see here
      });
      console.log(existingUser);
      if (existingUser) {
        const userExistsError = new ApiError(400, "User Already Exists", [
          { msg: "username or email already exist." },
        ]);
        return res.status(userExistsError.statusCode).json(userExistsError);
      }
```

Now error is gone.

## Improvement/Package Installation 6: New package “express-validator” is used for validations

- Earlier only if/else blocks were being used for user’s input data validation.
- It is a good way to do validation, but not great.
- Issues with If/Else validation:
    - Have to write a lot of code for any complex and even simple validations.
    - Maintaining it is a mess.
    - It polluted the code-base.
    - If anything goes wrong a lot of code has to corrected and debugged and too much time is consumed, some times time consumed doesn’t fix anything.
    - Etc.
- Benefits of using express validator:
    - I don’t need to debug simple things & if error occurs it is debugged easily compared to if/else.
    - It gives me features like (password length validation, email validation , username validation, etc.) right away & i don’t need to worry about its debugging as these features are maintained and developed by other smart developers.
    - Precious time is not consumed and work is done in time.
    - Maintainability is increased, code-base pollution is decreased.
    - Etc.
    

## New Features In This Instance:

- User is registered 2.x-3.x times faster.
Using Postman…
Earlier code took 8-13 seconds to register user in database under optimal conditions.
Current code takes only 3-4 seconds to register user under optimal conditions.
This Is Achieved By:
    - Flow of code is changed.
    - Certain async operations are not performed during some scenarios to increase speed and performance.
    - If/Else and Try/Catch at relevant place to control the flow and execution of code increasing speed and performance.
    - For example, async operations are not executed using if/else until all the user input is correctly validated.
- Validation is even more robust now using “express-validator”
    - Email is validated with many heavy checks.
    - Password now must be minimum 6 characters and strong.
    - FullName and UserName fields are now also heavily validated.
